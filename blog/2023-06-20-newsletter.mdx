**Welcome to the first ever conda community newsletter!**  The newsletter will highlight recent and upcoming activity that is relevant to the [conda community](https://conda.org/).  This first issue highlights releases, grants, events, ....

We are hoping these will become a semi-regular feature in the conda landscape going forward.  If you have an item to include in a future newsletter please let us know by posting it to the [Conda Communications Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/%23conda-communications:matrix.org) or by creating an issue in the [Conda Communications GitHub Repo](https://github.com/conda/communications/issues).

Finally, if you want to receive these newsletters from the comfort of your inbox, **please sign up for the [Conda Announce Mailing list](https://lists.conda.org/wws/info/announce).**

Happy reading,
The Editors


## Conda Community Gathering Spaces!

The past year has seen the launch of a cohort of places for the conda community to gather online.  Please join us:

* **[conda.org](https://conda.org)**: The conda community now has it's own [web site](https://conda.org).
* **[Q&A Forum](https://conda.discourse.group/)**: Q & about the entire ecosystem.
* **[Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#conda:matrix.org)**: Chat rooms about [everything](a), [conda-forge](a), [bioconda](a) [Constructor](a) and [Installer](a), [conda-build](a), [mamaba](a), [libmamba](a), ([Governance](a), [Communication](a)) and more.
* **[Conda Announce Mailing List](https://lists.conda.org/wws/info/announce)**: get monthly (or fewer) notifies about important conda stuff in your inbox (like this newsletter).

## Community calls

Please join us every other week to learn what is going on and to provide your input.

* The Mamba project has [bi-weekly community calls](https://hackmd.io/iOgkxNMpTea6lWczjCov9Q?view) on Tuesdays.  Our next call is June 27.
* The overall conda community has [bi-weekly calls](https://hackmd.io/@conda-community?tags=%5B%22meeting-notes%22%5D) on Wednesdays.  The next one is on June 21.

## SciPy 2023 Conda & Friends Sprint, July 15-16, Austin

<Image img={scipybanner} alt="Banner image for SciPy2023"/>

The [conda community will again be meeting] **(LINK TO MATRIX CHANNEL?)** at the [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/) meeting in Austin, Texas for two days of collaborative work.

[Sprints](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/sprints) are open to everyone who is interested in contributing to the various projects in the conda ecosystem (e.g. projects under the [conda](https://github.com/conda), [conda-incubator](https://github.com/conda-incubator), [mamba-org](https://github.com/mamba-org), [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge), ... GitHub organizations), what we call "conda and friends".

First and foremost, **the goal of conda community sprints is to grow the conda contributor community**.  We mean "contributor" in the broadest possible sense, not just code: Documentation, bug reports, forum questions (and answers), community events, new tools and plugs, and of course, new pull requests for existing tools too.

## PacakgingCon 2023, October 26-28, Berlin

<Image img={packagingcon} alt="Banner image for PackagingCon 2023"/>

[**PackagingCon 2023**](https://packaging-con.org/) brings together the software packaging community to present and discuss common challenges and unique solutions to software packaging. The conference is open to all packaging communities including language specific, OS specific, and broader solutions such as conda.

**[Abstract submission](https://cfp.packaging-con.org/2023/cfp) and [early registration](https://ti.to/packagingcon/packagingcon-2023) are now open for PackagingCon**.

PackagingCon 2023 will be held October 26-28 in Berlin, and will be a hybrid event. The call for submissions closes July 31. Early registration ends September 8, *but (in person) space is limited and you are encouraged to register early.*

## Rattler!

Any news?  Maybe highlight what Asmit is doing?

## Hmm, should there be a section here to link to recent interesing or response-needed posts from Discourse?

Dave thinks so, but it has to be timely, meaning we can't populate this until right before publishing.
