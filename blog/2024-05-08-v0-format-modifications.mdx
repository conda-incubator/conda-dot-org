  The recent approval of the new recipe format (`recipe.yaml`, v1) does not mean the end of the
  old format (`meta.yaml`, v0). The conda community must balance innovation with support for
  legacy systems.

The recent approval of a new recipe format (v1) by the Conda Steering Council
via [CEP-13][cep-13] and [CEP-14][cep-14] marks an important milestone in the
evolution of package management in the conda ecosystem. While the community
embraces the potential improvements that come with the new format, it's
essential to acknowledge that the v1 format is still under development and is
being prototyped in [rattler-build][rattler-build]. Consequently, the v0 format
remains widely in use, emphasizing the need to balance innovation with support
for legacy systems.

In any evolving ecosystem, such as conda, change is inevitable, requiring a
delicate balance between progress and continuity. While the acceptance of the v1
format signals a step forward, it also highlights the importance of ensuring
that updates to the existing v0 format align with proposals made in the new
format. Despite the approval of the v1 format, the transition to this new
standard will take time. In the interim, the v0 format continues to serve as the
backbone of many conda-build recipes, emphasizing the necessity of providing
ongoing support and updates to meet the evolving needs of the community.

The decision to introduce changes to the v0 format should be driven by the needs
of the user community. While the focus is on innovating with the v1 format, it's
essential to remain responsive to the challenges and requirements of those who
rely on the v0 format for their packaging needs. Updates to the v0 format should
be guided by user feedback and aimed at addressing pain points and enhancing
usability.

To initiate changes to the v0 conda-build recipe format, the following workflow
can be followed:

1. Proposal: Any proposed modifications to the v0 format should also be proposed
   in the v1 format. The rational here being, if it's necessary for v0 it should
   also be necessary for v1.
2. Approval: The proposed modification should undergo the same review and
   approval expected for the v1 format.
3. Implementation: Once approved, the changes can be implemented in the v0
   format, ensuring alignment with the corresponding features in the v1 format.

As the community navigates the transition from v0 to v1, clear communication and
guidance are paramount. Developers and maintainers need to be equipped with the
resources and support necessary to understand the implications of the new format
and make informed decisions about when and how to migrate. Additionally, robust
documentation and educational materials will play a crucial role in facilitating
this transition seamlessly.

The approval of the v1 format represents an exciting step forward for the conda
ecosystem. However, it's essential to recognize that change takes time, and the
transition to the new format will be gradual. In the interim, the v0 format
remains a critical component of many conda-build recipes, necessitating ongoing
support and updates. By striking a balance between innovation and continuity,
the conda community can ensure a smooth transition to the new standard while
continuing to meet the evolving needs of users.
