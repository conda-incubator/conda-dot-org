In the realm of package management and environment configuration, `conda` has
emerged as a versatile tool empowering developers with environment management. A
pivotal aspect of `conda`'s architecture lies in its prefix system, which
underwent a significant evolution over its versions, transforming `conda` from a
simple package manager into a sprawling environment manager. In this technical
discourse, we delve into the intricacies of `conda`'s prefix system, shedding
light on its evolution and the five distinct prefixes delineated within the
`conda` source code.

In the nascent stages of `conda`'s development, its primary functionality
revolved around installing packages into a singular environment, at the time
referred to as the `root` environment. This era, marked by `conda` versions
preceding 4.2.0, laid the groundwork for `conda`'s subsequent evolution as an
environment manager.

With the advent of [`conda 4.2.0`][conda-4.2.0] and beyond, a paradigm shift
occurred when the `conda-env` project was [merged][conda-env-pr] with the
`conda` project, elevating `conda` from a mere package manager to a
comprehensive environment manager. This pivotal transformation bestowed upon
`conda` the capability to create and manage separate environments, fostering
modularity and flexibility in development workflows.

Delving into `conda`'s Git history via `git blame` provides invaluable insights
into the timeline of the prefix system evolution. By tracing the commit history,
we unearth pivotal moments that introduced and refined the various prefixes
integral to `conda`'s architecture. The history is also revealing in how
non-linear the development of the prefix system has been, explaining many of the
complexities of trying to wrestle with the prefixes or trying to find ways to
simplify them.

1. `conda.base.context.context.conda_prefix`

   Introduced in `conda 4.2.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/6e730cc)
   as part of the private environment effort which has since been abandoned and
   deprecated.

   The `conda_prefix` lies at the heart of the prefix system, denoting the
   installation directory of `conda` itself. Typically, this aligns with the
   location of the `base` environment and is equivalent to Python's `sys.prefix`
   value.

   **Use this anytime you need to interact with the `conda` installation itself.**

2. `conda.base.context.context.root_prefix`

   > Previously `conda.config.root_dir` → `conda.config.ROOT_DIR`.

   Introduced in `conda 1.1.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/d2b370a)
   and was originally intended for testing purposes only.

   The `root_prefix` serves as a [configurable value][condarc], most easily
   configurable in the user's `~/.condarc` file. In the absence of user-defined
   preferences, it defaults to the `conda_prefix`.

   **Avoid using this. This is a contender for deprecation.**

3. `conda.base.context.context.active_prefix`

   Introduced in `conda 4.4.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/cbbe81f)
   as part of cleaning up the `conda info` output.

   Reflecting the currently active environment, the `active_prefix` is determined
   by the `$CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable which is set by the `conda activate`
   and `conda deactivate` commands.

   **Avoid using this. Treat this as an internal value.**

4. `conda.base.context.context.default_prefix`

   > Previously `conda.config.default_prefix` → `conda.config.DEFAULT_ENV_PREFIX` →
   > `conda.config.default_environment` → `conda.anaconda.default_environment`.

   Introduced in `conda 1.1.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/acd8144)
   as part of a larger configuration overhaul.

   The `default_prefix` effectively aggregates `root_prefix` and `active_prefix`,
   embodying the default environment in the absence of CLI overrides.

   **Avoid using this. Treat this as an internal value.**

5. `conda.base.context.context.target_prefix`

   > Previously `prefix` → `conda.cli.common.get_prefix()` →
   > `conda.cli.utils.get_prefix()`.

   Introduced in `conda 1.3.0` (see https://github.com/conda/conda/commit/9fd0f4b)
   to abstract out the `--name`/`--prefix` logic from the CLI implementations.

   The `target_prefix` is the final prefix and first reflects the user input via
   the CLI options, `--name` or `--prefix`. In the absence of CLI overrides, it
   defaults to the `default_prefix`.

   **Use this when you need to interact with the current environment.**

In essence, `conda` prefix system serves as the cornerstone of its environment
management capabilities, facilitating seamless navigation and interaction within
the different environments a user may have created. As `conda` continues to
evolve, understanding its prefix system remains paramount for harnessing its
capabilities effectively and correctly.
