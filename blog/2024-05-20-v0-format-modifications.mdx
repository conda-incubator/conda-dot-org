  The recent approval of the new recipe format (`recipe.yaml`, v1) does not mean the end of the
  old format (`meta.yaml`, v0). The conda community must balance innovation with support for
  legacy systems.

The recent approval of a new recipe format (v1) by the Conda Steering Council
via [CEP-13][cep-13] and [CEP-14][cep-14] marks an important milestone in the
evolution of package management in the conda ecosystem. While the community
embraces the potential improvements that come with the new format, it's
essential to acknowledge that the v1 format is still under development and is
being prototyped in [rattler-build][rattler-build]. Consequently, the v0 format
remains widely in use, emphasizing the need to balance innovation with support
for legacy systems.

In any evolving ecosystem, such as conda, change is inevitable; this requires a
delicate balance between progress and continuity. While the focus is on
innovating with the v1 format the transition and adoption will take time.
Consequently it's essential to remain responsive to the challenges and
requirements of those who continue to rely on the v0 format for their packaging
needs. Updates to the v0 format should be driven by the needs of the user
community, guided by user feedback, and aimed at addressing pain points.

To initiate changes to the v0 conda-build recipe format, the following workflow
can be followed:

1. Proposal: Any proposed modifications to the v0 format should also be proposed
   in the v1 format. The rationale here being, if it's necessary for v0 it should
   also be necessary for v1.
2. Approval: The proposed modification should undergo the same review and
   approval expected for the v1 format.
3. Implementation: Once approved, the changes can be implemented in the v0
   format, ensuring alignment with the corresponding features in the v1 format.

As the community navigates the transition from v0 to v1, clear communication and
guidance are paramount. Developers and maintainers need to be equipped with the
resources and support necessary to understand the implications of the new format
and make informed decisions about when and how to migrate. Additionally, robust
documentation and educational materials will play a crucial role in facilitating
this transition seamlessly.

The approval of the v1 format represents an exciting step forward for the conda
ecosystem. However, it's essential to recognize that change takes time, and the
transition to the new format will be gradual. In the interim, the v0 format
remains a critical component of many conda-build recipes, necessitating ongoing
support and updates. By striking a balance between innovation and continuity,
the conda community can ensure a smooth transition to the new standard while
continuing to meet the evolving needs of users.
